# Nestle-Product-Analytics

Ongoing Project under __10alytics__ Growth Internship Program (GIP)

Project completed as part of the real life case studies under __10alytics__ Growth Internship Program (GIP).

In this project, I used Power Query within Power BI to clean and prepare the data before saving and importing into the Power BI desktop where I used Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) within calculation table to visualize the year on year sales and other performance indicators of current products which will help justify the company's intention to add new product lines and expand their business.
